About
-----
This is a Snake game written in Python and Pygame.

Dependencies
------------

  * Pygame  (``sudo apt-get install python-pygame`` on Debian/Ubuntu)

To install Pygame for Python 3, you should to download this [experimental version](https://launchpad.net/debian/experimental/+source/pygame/1.9.2~pre~r3144-1/+files/pygame_1.9.2~pre~r3144.orig.tar.gz) and install the dependencies for Pygame:

  ``sudo apt-get install python3-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev  libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsmpeg-dev python-numpy subversion  libportmidi-dev``

Then go to the folder that you extracted for Pygame and run ``sudo python3 setup.py install``.

Usage
-----

Simply run ``python game.py`` (or ``python3 game.py`` if you're using Python 3).

That wasn't too hard, was it? :)
